I am a tiny useless chihuahua that makes gremlin sounds. I was bred to be a living hot water bottle. In addition to that, I am also a high-fiving pro as well as an expert cuddler, **BUT DON'T TOUCH MY HAUNCHES OR UNDERCARRIAGE**. And whatever you do, *don't you dare blow on me*.  



I am an unknown age and was adpoted from [Piece of Mind Dog Rescue](https://www.peaceofminddogrescue.org/index.php).
