I am a tiny useless chihuahua that makes gremlin sounds. I was bred to be a living hot water bottle. In addition to that, I am also a high fiving pro as well as an expert cuddler, **BUT DON'T TOUCH MY HAUNCHES OR UNDERCARRAGE**. And whatever you do, *don't you dare blow on me*.  

I am an unknown age and was adpoted from [Piece of Mind Dog Rescue](https://www.peaceofminddogrescue.org/index.php).


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
